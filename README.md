# GP4-Tictactoe
Tic-Tac-Toe with the option to play against someone or against an ai armed with minimax that will never lose


Quite happy with this code, the minimax works well however in some occasions it could win in the next move but decides to pick a different spot which still gurantees a win. This is due to me trying something to make it quicker and is quite funny as it drags out your defeat.
